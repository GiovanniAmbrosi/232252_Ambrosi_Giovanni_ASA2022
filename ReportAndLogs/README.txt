In the ReportandLogs there are 3 files where I simulated the scenario

-) In Simulation1day and Simulation3days the simulation is between houseAgent, carAgent and LightAgent

-) In Simulation1day the scenario is simulated without turning off the devices, to better show the consumption of the house and the function of the entire system

-) In Simulation3days the scenario is simulated in its final version

In the SimulationPlanning file it is simulated the scenario only with the planning agents


In order to understand better the file it is suggest to open the it with VSCode reading it as a log file instead of using Blocco Note or similars. The comments are highlighted in RED with three
reverse bars
